App uses react-native and react-native maps. Ask for permissions for users location. Once permission is given it shows map with a dot and flag at users location.
The maps api kEY isnt valid anymore, so youy have to use your own. You can click any spot on the map and it will tell you the elevation, not altitude. You can place marker any where on map and click the button for difference and it will tell you the difference in the elevation you are at and the elevation of your placed marker.
Also has a change map view button. Eventually going to add location search and some more stuff. First App where i had to really learn a lot about google maps. Anyone is welcome to make a contribution or add any idea they may have.Just submit your branch with pull request and I will take a look at it.
